Typing Speed Tester

Developed a HTML, CSS, and JavaScript-based typing speed assessment tool, evaluating user accuracy and speed; increased average typing speed by 20 WPM in a user base of 500+.
Commences the timer the moment user input is detected, and impeccably halts it when the entered text precisely matches the provided text, ensuring timing accuracy down to the millisecond during user interactions.
